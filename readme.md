# Welcome in the "Debug CSS in the navigator" workshop

You can see the wanted result (a solution) by using the "Voir l'objectif final" link at the bottom of the page. Once open, you can close the tab like any cookie banner (no worries about that).

## Solve the exercice

You should use only the browser source or the element inspector.

Warning: don't refresh the page, otherwise you will lose all your work !!!

## Some mistakes were made

Do your best, and find them. At the end, feel free to improve the design.

- Be aware of the general layout (\*, body, html);
- Check global element style like h2, .btn, a
- header : choose the correct layout using flex, this should avoid the use of inappropriate margin or padding to correct it
- hero : No p√Æcture, could that be the path ??? and a nasty layout choice
- presentation : warning classes are not ids...
- values : observe your html, is the selector correct to target children ?
- team : check the unit (px, rem, % and so on). Which one is just wrong to match the property flex
- footer : naming a variable is always tricky, and a source of mistakes. But everything is going in the wrong order !!!
