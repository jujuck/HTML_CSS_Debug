### Welcome in the Debug CSS in the navigator workshop

You will find the goal (one solution) on the link on the bottom of the page. Once open, you can easily close the tab, as a cookie banner (no worries about that);

# The solve the exercice, you should use only the source of the navigator or the element inspector

Warning: don't refresh your work, cause you will lose all your work !!!

# A couple of mistake were made

Just find it and do your best. At the end, feel free to improve the design

- Be aware of the general disposition (\*, body, html);
- Check, the style of the global element as h2, .btn, a
- header : choose the right disposition on flex, this should avoid the use of inappropriate margin or padding to correct it
- hero : No p√Æcture, could be the path ??? and some unkind choice in disposition
- presentation : warning class are not id...
- values : observe your html, is the selector correct to target the children ?
- team : check for unity (px, rem, % and so on). Which one is just wrong to match the property flex
- footer : naming variable is always tricky and a source of mistakes. But all is on the wrong order !!!
